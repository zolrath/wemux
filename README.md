![wemux: Multi-User Tmux Sessions Made Easy](http://i.imgur.com/iOjcz.png)
********************************************************************************

wemux enhances tmux to make multi-user terminal multiplexing both easier and
more powerful. It allows users to host a wemux server and have clients join
in either:

**Mirror Mode** gives clients (another SSH user on your machine) read-only
access to the session, allowing them to see you work, or

**Pair Mode** allows the client and yourself to work in the same terminal
(shared cursor)

**Rogue Mode** allows the client to pair or work independently in another
window (separate cursors) in the same tmux session.

It features multi-server support as well as user listing
and notifications when users attach/detach.

## How To Install
  **IMPORTANT**: Wemux requires tmux version >= 1.6
  
### MacPorts (on OS X)
  If you have [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) installed you can
  install wemux with a very simple:

    sudo port install wemux

### Homebrew (on OS X)
  If you have [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) installed you can
  install wemux with a fairly simple:

    brew install wemux

  The user that installed wemux will automatically be added to the wemux host list.
  To change the host or add more hosts, edit `/usr/local/etc/wemux.conf` and add the
  username to the host_list array.

  Users in the host_list will be able to start new wemux servers, all other
  users will be wemux clients and join these servers.

    $ vim /usr/local/etc/wemux.conf
         OR
    $ wemux conf

    host_list=(zolrath brocksamson)

### Manual Installation
  The rest of this readme will operate under the assumption you'll place wemux
  in `wemux/` in your `/usr/local/share` directory. To make wemux available for
  all users, perform the following steps, using sudo as required:

  Git clone this repo.

    git clone git://github.com/zolrath/wemux.git /usr/local/share/wemux

  Symlink the `wemux` file into your $PATH via `/usr/local/bin/`,
  being sure to use the full path.

    ln -s /usr/local/share/wemux/wemux /usr/local/bin/wemux

  **IMPORTANT**: Copy the `wemux.conf.example` file to `/usr/local/etc/wemux.conf`

    cp /usr/local/share/wemux/wemux.conf.example /usr/local/etc/wemux.conf

  Then set a user to be a wemux host by adding their username to the host_list in
  `/usr/local/etc/wemux.conf`. Users in the host_list will be able to start new wemux
  servers, all other users will be wemux clients and join these servers.

    vim /usr/local/etc/wemux.conf
    host_list=(zolrath brocksamson)

  To upgrade to a new version of wemux return to the `/usr/local/share/wemux`
  directory and perform a `git pull`

## Host Commands
#### wemux start
  Use `wemux start` to start a wemux server, chmod /tmp/wemux-wemux to 1777 so
  that other users may connect to it, and attach to it.  If a wemux server
  already exists, it will attach to it instead.
#### wemux attach
  Use `wemux attach` to attach to an existing wemux server.
#### wemux stop
  Use `wemux stop` to stop the wemux server and remove the /tmp/wemux-wemux
  socket.
#### wemux kill
  Use `wemux kill` to stop the wemux server and forcibly remove the 
  /tmp/wemux-wemux socket (using sudo).
#### wemux kick *username*
  Use `wemux kick <username>` to kick an SSH user from the server and remove
  their wemux rogue sessions.
#### wemux config
  Use `wemux config` to open `/usr/local/etc/wemux.conf` in your $EDITOR.
  Note this only works if you have the environment variable EDITOR configured.
#### wemux
  When `wemux` is run without any arguments in host mode, it is just like
  running wemux start.  It will reattach to an existing wemux server if it
  exists, otherwise it will start a new server.

## Client Commands
#### wemux mirror
  Use `wemux mirror` to attach to server in read-only mode.
#### wemux pair
  Use `wemux pair` to attach to server in pair mode, allowing the client to 
  control the terminal as well.
#### wemux rogue
  Use `wemux rogue` to attach to server in rogue mode, which allows both editing
  with the host and switching to windows independently from the host.
#### wemux logout
  Use `wemux logout` to remove your rogue mode session.
#### wemux
  When `wemux` is run without any arguments in client mode, its behavior
  attempts to intelligently select mirror, pair, or rogue:

  * If the client does not have an existing rogue session it will attach to the
  wemux server in pair mode.
  * If the client has already started a wemux rogue session, it will
  reattach to the server in rogue mode.
  * If both rogue and pair mode are disabled, it will attach in mirror mode.
  * By setting `default_client_mode="rogue"` in `wemux.conf` this can be changed
  to always join in rogue mode, even if a rogue session doesn't already exist.

#### Other Commands
  wemux passes commands it doesn't understand through to tmux with the correct
  socket setting.

  `wemux list-sessions` is equivalent to entering `tmux -S /tmp/wemux-wemux
  list-sessions`

## User List
  wemux can display a list of connected users, indicating users in mirror mode
  with [m] at the end of their name.

  If you'd like to see a list of all users currently connected to the wemux
  server, you have three options:

### wemux users
  Enter `wemux users` in the terminal to display a list of all currently
  connected wemux users.

    $ wemux users
    Users connected to 'wemux':
      1. zolrath
      2. csagan[m]

### Status Bar
  You can add the user list to your status bar by adding #(wemux status_users)
  where you see fit by editing your `~/tmux.conf` file.

    set -g status-right "#(wemux status_users)"

### Display Message
  If you'd rather display users on command via a tmux message, similar to the
  user attachment/detachment messages, you can do so by editing your
  `~/tmux.conf` file.  Pick whatever key you'd like to bind the displaying the
  message to. Using t as an example:

    unbind t
    bind t run-shell 'wemux display_users'

  Note that the tmux prefix should be pressed before t to activate the command.

  User listing can be disabled by setting `allow_user_list="false"` in
  `wemux.conf`

### Short-form Commands
  All commands have a short form. s for start, a for attach, p for pair etc.
  For a complete list, type `wemux help` (or `wemux h`)

# Multi-Host Capabilities
********************************************************************************

  wemux supports specifying the joining different wemux servers via `wemux join
  <server>`. This allows multiple hosts on the same machine to host their own
  independent wemux servers with their own clients. By default this option is
  disabled.

  wemux will remember the last server specified to in order to make reconnecting
  to the same server easy. `wemux help` will output the currently specified
  server along with the wemux command list.

  Changing servers can be enabled by setting `allow_server_change="true"` in
  `/usr/local/etc/wemux.conf`

### Joining Different wemux Servers
  To change the wemux server run `wemux join <server>`. The name will be sanitized to contain no spaces or uppercase letters.

    $ wemux join Project X
    Changed wemux server from 'wemux' to 'project-x'
    $ wemux
    $ wemux stop
    $ wemux reset
    Changed wemux server from 'project-x' to 'wemux'

#### wemux join *servername*
  Join wemux server with specified name.

    $ wemux join rails
    Changed wemux server from 'wemux' to 'rails'

#### wemux join *servernumber*
  Alternatively, enter the server number displayed next to the server name in `wemux list`.

    $ wemux j 1
    Changed wemux server from 'rails' to 'project-x'

#### wemux join
  Join with no argument simply displays the current wemux server, if you're into that.

    $ wemux join
    Current wemux server: wemux

### Resetting the Server Name
  In order to easily return to the default server you can run `wemux reset`
#### wemux reset
  Joins the default wemux server: wemux (or value of default_server_name in wemux.conf)

    $ wemux reset
    Changed wemux server from 'project-x' to 'wemux'

### Active Server List
  To list the name of all currently running wemux servers run `wemux list`
#### wemux list
  List all currently active wemux servers.

    $ wemux list
    Currently active wemux servers:
      1. project-x
      2. rails
      3. wemux    <- current server

  `wemux join` and `wemux stop` both accept either the name of a server or
  the number indicated next to the name in `wemux list`.

  Listing servers can be disabled by setting `allow_server_list="false"` in
  `/usr/local/etc/wemux.conf`

# Configuration
********************************************************************************

  There are a number of additional options that be configured in
  `/usr/local/etc/wemux.conf`.  In most cases the only option that must be changed is the
  `host_list` array. To open your wemux configuration file, you can either open
  `/usr/local/etc/wemux.conf` manually or run `wemux config`

### Host Mode
  To have an account act as host, ensure that you have added their username to the
  `/usr/local/etc/wemux.conf` file's `host_list` array.

    host_list=(zolrath hostusername brocksamson)

### Pair Mode
  Pair mode can be disabled, only allowing clients to attach to the server in
  mirror mode by setting `allow_pair_mode="false"`

### Rogue Mode
  Rogue mode can be disabled, only allowing clients to attach to the server in
  mirror or pair mode by setting `allow_rogue_mode="false"`

### Default Client Mode
 When clients enter 'wemux' with no arguments by default it will first attempt to
 join an existing rogue mode session. If there is no rogue session it will start
 in pair mode.
 By setting default_client_mode to "rogue", 'wemux' with no arguments will always
 join a rogue mode session, even if it has to create it.

  This can be changed by setting `default_client_mode="rogue"`

### Default Server Name
  The default wemux server name will be used with `wemux reset` and when
  `allow_server_name` is not enabled in `wemux.conf`.

  This can be changed by setting `default_server_name="customname"`

### Changing Servers
  The ability to change servers can be enabled by setting
  `allow_server_change="true"`

### Listing Servers
  Listing servers can be disabled by setting `allow_server_list="false"`

### Listing Users
  Listing users can be disabled by setting `allow_user_list="false"` in
  `wemux.conf`

### Kicking SSH Users
  Kicking SSH users from the server can be disabled by setting
  `allow_kick_user="false"` in `wemux.conf`

### Announcements
  When a user joins a server in either mirror, pair, or rogue mode, a message is
  displayed to all currently attached users:

    csagan has attached in mirror mode.
    csagan has detached.

 This can be disabled by setting `announce_attach="false"`

 In addition, when a user switches from one server to another via the `wemux
 join <servername>` command, their movement is displayed similarly to the
 attach messages.

  If csagan enters `wemux join applepie` the users on the default server
  `wemux` will see:

    csagan has switched to server: applepie

  If csagan returns to default server with: `wemux reset` users on `wemux`
  will see:

    csagan has joined this server.

  This can be disabled by setting `announce_server_change="false"`

### Automatic SSH Client Modes
  To make an SSHed user start in a wemux mode automatically, add one of the
  following lines to the users `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`

  **Option 1**: Automatically log the client into mirror mode upon login,
  disconnect them from the server when they detach.

    wemux mirror; exit

  **Option 2**: Automatically start the client in mirror mode but allow them to
  detach.

    wemux mirror

  **Option 3**: Automatically start the client in pair mode but allow them to
  detach.

    wemux pair
    
  **Option 4**: Automatically start the client in rogue mode but allow them to
  detach.

    wemux rogue

  **Option 5**: Only display the connection commands, don't automatically start
  any modes.

    wemux help

  Please note that this does not ensure a logged in user will not be able to exit
  tmux and access their shell. If the user is not trusted, you must perform any
  security measures one would normally perform for a remote user.
